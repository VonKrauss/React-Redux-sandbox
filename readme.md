REACT+REDUX SANDBOX
=======

This is a barebones project designed to break things, or start them anew. It contains my personal preferences in terms of node modules and linter configuration.

Sublime Text plugins that will help you
---------

- **ESlint**: Great linter with react rules. Highly customizable.
- **Babel**: For JSX color highlighting.
- **Sass**: The project uses sass loaders that automatically compile sass with webpack updates.
